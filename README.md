## About
This repo is intended for any individual wanting to improve their problem
solving skills for software engineering interviews. 

Problems are grouped under their respective subtopic, in order to focus on
repeatedly applying common patterns rather than randomly tackling questions.

There are several leetcode patterns lists from such resources as:
- **Curated list of top 75 Leetcode questions** from [Blind](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-100-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU) article
- **Neetcode 150** list of Leetcode questions from [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice)
- **Neetcode All** list of top 311 Leetcode questions from [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/practice)
- [**Leetcode patterns**](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) list of top 171 Leetcode questions [Sean Prashad](https://github.com/SeanPrashad)
- **Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions list of Leetcode questions from** [educative.io](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview)
- [**Leetcode explore learn cards**](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/) questions by topics - list of 204 Leetcode questions
- **170 Coding Interview Questions** from [AlgoExpert.io](https://www.algoexpert.io/questions)

All questions are available on [leetcode.com], [neetcode.io], [algoexpert.io].

## Fundamentals

- Linked Lists
- Queues
- Heaps
- Stacks
- Trees
- Graphs

In addition, you should have a good grasp on common algorithms such as:
- Breadth-first search
- Depth-first search
- Binary search
- Recursion
